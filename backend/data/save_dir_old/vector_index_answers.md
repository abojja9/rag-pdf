The document provides guidance on streamlining regulatory reporting 
requirements for Designated Depository Participants (DDPs) and Custodians.
It outlines the frequency and format of various reports that DDPs and 
Custodians need to submit to SEBI. These reports include audited annual 
reports, net worth certificates, AI/ML reports, quarterly custodian 
reports, FPI general information, details of FPIs granted exemptions, 
changes in material information, and reports on short sales by FPIs. The 
reporting formats were finalized in consultation with pilot Custodians and
the Designated Depository Participants Standard Setting Forum (CDSSF). 
DDPs and Custodians are required to disclose these reporting formats on 
their websites and ensure compliance with the new reporting requirements.

2. It requires monthly reporting on changes in material information where 
there is a delay of 6 months, and short sales by FPIs.  

3. It mentions reporting formats finalized in consultation with pilot 
Custodians and the CDSSF (Custodians and Designated Depository 
Participants Standard Setting Forum), which will be shared by CDSSF and 
disclosed on DDPs' and Custodians' websites.

4. It specifies that reporting by DDPs under a certain clause shall be 
done monthly on the SI portal.

5. The circular is issued under the powers conferred by the SEBI Act, 
1992, to protect investors' interests and regulate the securities market.
