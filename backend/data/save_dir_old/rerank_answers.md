The document appears to be a circular issued by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regarding the streamlining of regulatory 
reporting by Designated Depository Participants (DDPs) and Custodians. The
key points are:

1. SEBI has finalized reporting formats in consultation with pilot 
Custodians, Designated Depository Participants, and the Standard Setting 
Forum (CDSSF).

2. CDSSF will share these reporting formats with all DDPs and Custodians, 
who must disclose them on their respective websites.

3. DDPs are required to report on a monthly basis through the SI portal, 
as per Clause 14(iii) of Part A of the Master Circular for Foreign 
Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and DDPs.

The circular aims to standardize and streamline the regulatory reporting 
process for DDPs and Custodians, ensuring consistency and compliance with 
SEBI's guidelines.
